# Magic

## Introduction
Magic is the power of inputting a certain amount and type of mana and outputting it as a spell. Magic is based on 8 basic elements: earth, water, air, fire, light, dark, space, and time. Simple spells are cast with just one element, but higher difficulty spells are multi elemental.

According to ancient legends:
When the realm was originally formed, the Gods born *8 Original Spirits* to lay claim to the *8 True Elements* that were used for the realms creation. There was __Terros the Great March__, __Aquos the Low Tide__, __Galos the Raging Breath__, __Ignios the Dragon Ancestor__, __Luxos the Purecrown__, __Oblos the Nightwalker__, __Banos the Hidden Expanse__, and __Horos the First Watcher__.

__Terros the Great March__ was a bull spirit. His given domain ranged from the top of mountains to the deepest of caves. His constant forming and crushing led to the land we know today. Thus, Earth Magic was formed.

__Aquos the Low Tide__ was a whale spirit. Her protecting of the raging seas led to the vast life and vibrant ocean we know today. Thus, Water Magic was given.

__Galos the Raging Breath__ was a hawk spirit. Her patrol of the skies brought upon the immerse sky we know today. Thus, Air Magic was created.

__Ignios the Dragon Ancestor__ was a lizard spirit. His resting within the hottest layers of the land led to the passionate flames we know today. Thus, Fire Magic was forged.

__Luxos the Purecrown__ was a deer spirit. His care of the great forests let multitudes of ecosystems flourish. Thus, Light Magic was passed.

__Oblos the Nightwalker__ was a wolf spirit. His lurking within the shadowy realms allowed for the day and night be so distinguished. Thus, Dark Magic was risen.

__Banos the Hidden Expanse__ was a worm spirit. His claim of the vast depths of the underground gave origination to the deepest caverns explored today. Thus, Space Magic was found.

__Horos the First Watcher__ was a spider spirit. Her gaze upon all the world's paths kept our time normal. Without this watching, our time would least to exist. Thus, Time Magic was known.

The magic known today is derived from this story.


## Magic Tiers

### Basic Tier
The first tier of the magic system is the basic elements. Each being is formed with 2 main systems for gauging their magical abilities: *Compatibility* and *Capability*. The compatibility of a being is the four elements they are most likely to be able to use. The general belief is that the __Natural Elements__ - Earth, Water, Fire, and Air - are the easiest to pick up with 88% of beings compatible. Next the __Simple Elements__ - Light and Dark - generally have 10% compatibility with beings. Finally, the __Complex Elements__ - Time and Space - only see 2% compatibility for beings. 

After a being's four compatible elements are determined, then their capability to each is next. The higher the capability one has to an element, the higher Tier of magic they will be able to use. The scores are such: 10~20% capability basic tier, 20% low tier, 40% mid tier, 60% high tier, 80% Advanced Tier, 90% Supreme Tier, and 98% Mythical tier. Lets say I have a 70% capability score for the Fire element, the highest tier of fire magics I most likely will be able to reach is High tier.

### Low Tier
The second tier, the low tier of magic, is a simple refinment of the 8 basic elements. The individuals who reach this level of magic have gotten a better understanding of the element they use. 

### Mid Tier
The mid tier of magic is the door to dual elemental magic. From the basic tier of finding your element and then the next of refining your new discovery, the third tier is your discovery of the next element you can master. Dual element magic is the understanding of how two elements coexist.

### High Tier
The high tier of magic is to those individuals who have gained a stronger understanding of their primary element or their dual elementsl abilities. 

### Superior Tier
The superior tier of magic is open to individuals who gain an intricate understanding of a third elemental and how it blends with their current abilities.

### Supreme Tier
The blessed few that reach the supreme tier of magic stand at a diffrent level than others. The casters that grace this level fully know the capabilities of their element(s) and how to advance them. They are formidablly strong.

### Mythical Tier
The mythical tier is the stuff of legends. The strongest of mages that gain an understanding of how to balance quad elemental casting are rewarded with the strongest forms of magic. 

### Divine Tier
The divine tier of magic is able to classify the expansive magic of dieties and gods. Mortals cannot comprehend the power and abilities of the gods.
